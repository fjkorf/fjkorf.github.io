## About this page

This page is written in Frank's Markup Language. I have a lightweight FML processor written rust and loaded through WebAssembly. This FML processor is responsible for transforming the FML source into HTML. Neat.

Try playing with the textarea at the bottom.

## About Frank Korf

### A lifetime of writing code.

I am equal parts artist, mathematician, scientist, and clown, but mostly I am a programmer. I have spent decades reading and writing every coding language I can find. I am passionate about developing internal and external software solutions that result in  bottom-line business value. My success does not come from my personal programming knowledge, but instead from my ability to work with others. I can engage with developers at any experience level and help give the the tools they need to solve their unique problems.

"Playfully doing something difficult, whether useful or not, that is hacking." -Richard Stallman
