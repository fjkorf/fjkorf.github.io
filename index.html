# Hello, I am Frank!

I develop software, teams, and individuals.
I like to talk about art, science, and the future.

## About this page

This page is written in Frank's Markup Language. I have a lightweight FML processor written rust and loaded through WebAssembly. This FML processor is responsible for transforming the FML source into HTML. Neat.

## About Frank Korf

#### A lifetime of writing code.

I am equal parts artist, mathematician, scientist, and clown, but mostly I am a programmer. I have spent decades reading and writing every coding language I can find. I am passionate about developing internal and external software solutions that result in  bottom-line business value. My success does not come from my personal programming knowledge, but instead from my ability to work with others. I can engage with developers at any experience level and help give the the tools they need to solve their unique problems.

## A 90 Day Plan

How can you transform you software development workplace in 90 days? It starts with what you are trying to transform. I believe there are synergies between developers personally learning and growing and high-quality software. Software can be performant, fault-tolerant, and engaging for the end user. I believe this kind of software spawns most frequently in a specific kind of developer environment. The process I like to outline consists of 3 keys: engage the developers curiosity, encourage exploration, and ensure the delivery consistently good code.

The first 30 focus on curiousity. Be curious and find the deliverables. Who is recieving code, how frequently, and how is feedback managed? Additionally, encourage the group to be curious. Watch and share conference talks. Anything interesting is worth sharing.

The second 30 are about exploration. The key to high quality exploration is high-quality experiments. Clear hypotheses, an attention to necessary rigor, and careful examination of results. As a leader it is important to align the values of high-quality software and the greater goals of the software and organization.

The final 30 is about delivering. Get the team on stage and start getting feedback. Plan, execute, deliver, review, repeat.
